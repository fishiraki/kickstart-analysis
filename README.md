# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to determine the likelihood of success for a fundraising campaign relative to launch date or campagin goal dollar value.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

I utilized current and prior knowledge of working with pivot tables and Excel in general to arrive at this analysis. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

I utilized current and prior knowledge of working with pivot tables and Excel in general to arrive at this analysis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The main challenge that I ran into was skimming through the section regarding converting a UNIX time stampe to a typical date format.  After asking the class on Slack, Lizzy (TA) assisted me with identifying which section that I should refer to in the coursework to learn how to do this.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Campaigns beginning in Q2 have the highest likelihood of success, thus this is an ideal time to launch a new campaign.  Especailly since there are no specific launch dates where the likelihood of the campaign failing or being cancelled is significantly higher than normal. 

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Outside of the (35k to 45k) range, there is a distinct negative correlation between campaign goal dollar value and success.  Even though the 35k to 45k segment is an outlier from the trend, the likelihood of a campaign this sized being a success is still less than the average.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?

We could use information on the marketing reach of each campaign

We could use information on the campaign creator 

We could use qualitative data (i.e. surveys) for each campaign

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Analysis on average gift size and campaign goal dollar value to determine if larger valued campaigns entice larger gifts

Analysis on campaign success probability relative to the differing major currencies

Analysis of campaign success relative to campaign duration by campaign goal size to determine if there is a sweet spot in terms of campaign success based on goal dollar value and duration

Analysis of campaign competition to determine if certain campaigns did not succeed simply due to there being too many active campaigns for donors to consider funding
